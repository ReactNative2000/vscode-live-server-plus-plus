DO NOT consider this legal advice. This file explains the license chosen for this repository and provides a quick checklist for common legal tasks.

Repository: vscode-live-server-plus-plus
Default license: MIT (see `LICENSE`)

What this means (short):
- You may use, copy, modify, and distribute the code for any purpose, including commercial, as long as you include the copyright notice and license.
- The software is provided "as is" without warranty. The authors are not liable for damages.

If you need a different license (GPL, Apache-2.0, proprietary, etc.) or a contributor agreement (CLA), update the `LICENSE` file and consult a lawyer for binding legal advice.

Recommended next steps:
- If you want a corporate copyright holder (instead of `ReactNative2000`), replace the owner line in `LICENSE`.
- If you accept external contributions, consider adding a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
- If you require export control, trademark, or other restrictions, consult legal counsel.
