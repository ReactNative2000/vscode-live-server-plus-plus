# Reflection Form — Project Overview

This repository contains a resilient student reflection form and supporting documentation. The working form and PWA assets live under `/docs`.

See `/docs` for usage, local testing, and admin tools.

## GitHub Pages

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow which publishes the `docs/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch. After a successful run the site will be available at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>` or at your configured custom domain.

Quick steps:

1. Push to `master` or `gh-pages` (or manually run the `Deploy GitHub Pages` workflow in Actions).
2. Check Actions for a successful `Deploy GitHub Pages` run.
3. Verify the Pages settings in the repository Settings → Pages and open the listed URL.
