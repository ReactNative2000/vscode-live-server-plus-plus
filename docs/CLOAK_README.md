## Cloak: ordering, printing and DIY

This document helps you get a physical cloak or a printed nameplate. It also explains how to use the SVG mockups in `images/`.

Files provided:

- `images/cloak_with_name.svg` — full-color vector mockup with a nameplate placeholder ("YOUR NAME").
- `images/cloak_with_name_mono.svg` — monochrome variant good for embroidery or single-color printing.

## Printing & vendor options

- **Embroidery**: send `cloak_with_name_mono.svg` to an embroidery shop. They typically require an outline or vector file (SVG/PDF) and will digitize the design. Monochrome file is best.

- **DTF / Heat transfer**: use `cloak_with_name.svg` (color). A print shop can print a transfer and apply it to fabric with a heat press.

- **Sublimation (polyester fabric)**: convert the SVG to a 300 DPI PNG sized to the nameplate area and use sublimation printing.

## Recommended vendors

- Etsy / local tailors — for custom sewn cloaks with embroidered nameplates.
- CustomInk / Vistaprint — for printed transfers and small-run customization.
- Local fabric printers — for DTF / heat transfer jobs.

## DIY printing steps (heat-transfer)

1. Export the SVG to a high-resolution PNG sized to the desired nameplate (e.g., 1200×480 px).
2. Send PNG to a print shop for DTF / heat transfer printing.
3. Use a household iron or heat press to apply the transfer to your cloak fabric (follow transfer instructions).

## Sizing and fabric

- Cloak length: measure from the base of the neck to desired hem — typical adult cloak 120–140 cm, child 80–100 cm.
- Width: allow wrap-around freedom; typical adult cloak width 140 cm.
- Fabric: recommend mid-weight wool blend, cotton twill, or heavy velvet for a dramatic drape. Use lining for comfort.

## Using the SVG

Open the SVG in any vector editor (Inkscape, Illustrator) and replace the `YOUR NAME` text with your name. Save as SVG and export PNG as needed.
