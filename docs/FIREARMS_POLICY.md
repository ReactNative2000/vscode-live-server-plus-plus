# Firearms and Weapons Safety Policy

This repository and the associated public-facing pages (the `docs/` site) are focused on software, privacy, and community tools. We maintain a neutral, safety-first policy regarding firearms and weapons-related content.

This document describes the policy in brief and how to report concerns. It is intentionally non-actionable and does not provide instructions for acquiring, modifying, or using weapons.

## Allowed content

- Historical, academic, or journalistic discussion of firearms and weapons when it is clearly contextualized and not instructional.
- High-level policy discussions, legal analysis, or references to public resources about regulation and safety.
- Content focused on safety, de-escalation, storage, and harm-reduction without operational details.

## Disallowed content

- Instructions or techniques for building, modifying, or evading safety mechanisms of weapons.
- Advice intended to facilitate harm, illegal activity, or bypassing law enforcement or safety protocols.

## Reporting concerns

If you believe content in this repository or the `docs/` site violates this policy or contains disallowed material, please open an issue, or contact the project maintainers directly. When reporting, please include:

- A link to the file or page in question.
- A short explanation of the concern and why it may be disallowed under this policy.

Maintainers will review reports promptly. If the content is determined to violate this policy, it will be removed or redacted and replaced with safer, non-actionable content.

## Moderation notes

- This policy is intentionally narrow and non-political. Its purpose is to prevent the repository from hosting operational instructions that could facilitate harm.
- The project maintainers reserve the right to remove content that poses a clear risk of harm or that conflicts with repository hosting policies.

_This policy was added to the project documentation to provide clarity about firearms-related content and safety._

## FIREARMS SAFETY & POLICY

This project and its maintainers prioritize safety, legality, and responsible information sharing. The following notes describe how the project approaches content related to firearms and weapons.

### 1. No instructions for manufacture or modification

This repository will not provide step-by-step instructions for manufacturing, modifying, or operating firearms in a way that could facilitate harm. Requests for such instructions will not be fulfilled.

### 2. High-level, non-actionable resources

When discussing firearms we will prefer high-level, non-actionable resources such as public safety guidelines, legal/regulatory links, and links to professional training and certification organizations.

### 3. Legal compliance

Contributors should ensure any content they add is compliant with applicable local, state, and national laws. This project does not provide legal advice; consult a qualified professional for legal questions.

### 4. Safety-first language

All content should encourage safe handling, secure storage, and lawful use. When linking to external resources, prefer established safety organizations and government guidance.

### 5. Moderation and reporting

Content that violates this policy (for example, detailed instructions for illegal activity) will be removed. If you see content that appears to violate these guidelines, please open an issue or contact the maintainers.

### 6. Donations and affiliations

The project will not accept donations or endorsements from organizations that promote illegal or unsafe use of weapons. If you propose a funding source related to firearms, the maintainers will evaluate it against this policy.

If you want a different tone or additional sections (for example: region-specific legal checklists, links to certified training providers, or a short FAQ), tell me which ones to add and I will update the file.
