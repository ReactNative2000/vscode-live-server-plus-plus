FIREARMS SAFETY & POLICY

This project and its maintainers prioritize safety, legality, and responsible information sharing. The following notes describe how the project approaches content related to firearms and weapons.

1. No instructions for manufacture or modification
- This repository will not provide step-by-step instructions for manufacturing, modifying, or operating firearms in a way that could facilitate harm. Requests for such instructions will not be fulfilled.

2. High-level, non-actionable resources
- When discussing firearms we will prefer high-level, non-actionable resources such as public safety guidelines, legal/regulatory links, and links to professional training and certification organizations.

3. Legal compliance
- Contributors should ensure any content they add is compliant with applicable local, state, and national laws. This project does not provide legal advice; consult a qualified professional for legal questions.

4. Safety-first language
- All content should encourage safe handling, secure storage, and lawful use. When linking to external resources, prefer established safety organizations and government guidance.

5. Moderation and reporting
- Content that violates this policy (for example, detailed instructions for illegal activity) will be removed. If you see content that appears to violate these guidelines, please open an issue or contact the maintainers.

6. Donations and affiliations
- The project will not accept donations or endorsements from organizations that promote illegal or unsafe use of weapons. If you propose a funding source related to firearms, the maintainers will evaluate it against this policy.

If you want a different tone or additional sections (for example: region-specific legal checklists, links to certified training providers, or a short FAQ), tell me which ones to add and I will update the file.
