King James Version (excerpt) â€” Public Domain

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

(Excerpt: Genesis 1:1-3)
