# Asylum application — plain-language template

Use this template as a starting point for drafting an asylum/immigration protection statement. This is a generic, non-exhaustive form intended to help you organize facts and evidence. It is not legal advice — consult a lawyer or accredited representative for jurisdiction-specific requirements and deadlines.

---

## 2. Summary of why I am seeking protection (one paragraph)

Write a short, clear statement summarizing the core reason you fear returning to your country of origin. Keep it factual and avoid long legal arguments here.

Example: "I fear return because I was targeted by [group/authority] on account of my [political activism/religion/membership]. On [date], they [describe incident]. Since then, I have received threats and there is no protection available from local authorities."

---

## 3. Chronology and specific incidents (list dates, places, people)

For each incident, include:
- Date (or approximate date)
- Location
- Who did what (names, descriptions)
- Why you believe it happened (motive)
- Injuries, losses, or tangible impacts
- Any police/official reports and outcomes

Example entry:

- Date: 2023-08-15
- Location: City X
- Perpetrator: Members of Group Y (identified themselves), threatened to kill me for publishing articles critical of local officials.
- What happened: They beat me and posted photos of the attack online with my name.
- Outcome: I filed a police report (report #123). The police did not investigate and warned me to stop political activity.

---

## 4. Why local protection is not available

Explain attempts (if any) to seek help from police, courts, or other authorities and why those attempts failed or are not possible. Mention corruption, collusion, inability to access services, or the authorities being the perpetrators.

---

## 5. Evidence and supporting documents

List documents and evidence you have (attach copies where possible):
- Identity documents (passport, national ID)
- Police reports
- Medical records, photos of injuries
- Witness statements or contact info
- News reports or social media posts corroborating incidents
- Membership records, arrest certificates, detention records
- Any other evidence (explain briefly)

## 6. Additional relevant facts

Include information about:
- Family members affected
- Travel history and attempts to leave
- Membership in political/religious groups
- Sexual orientation/gender identity (if relevant and if disclosure is safe)

---

## 7. Relief requested

State clearly what you are asking the decision-maker to grant (e.g., asylum/protection status, stay of removal, humanitarian parole). If you seek specific accommodations, list them.

---

## 8. Declaration and signature

I declare under penalty of perjury that the facts stated in this application are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Applicant signature: ____________________  Date: __________

Name (printed): ________________________

## Practical checklist (before you file)

- Make clear copies of identity documents.
- Scan and attach all supporting evidence you have.
- Keep an evidence log listing file names and descriptions.
- Note deadlines and filing addresses; missing a deadline can be critical.
- Consider seeing a lawyer or accredited representative — many organizations provide free help.

## Notes for editors / maintainers

- This template is intentionally plain-language so it is easier for applicants to fill in facts. Local forms and procedures differ — add jurisdiction-specific filing instructions (where to send, fees, how to submit evidence) in a short companion doc when publishing.
- Keep a privacy notice on pages that collect personal information and avoid storing sensitive data in public repositories.
