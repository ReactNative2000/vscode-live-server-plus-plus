# Military-themed Branding & Legal Guidance

Use this guidance when designing a lawful, public-facing site with a military aesthetic (for veterans groups, reenactors, gaming clans, or advocacy organizations). This is not legal advice — consult counsel for formal checks.

Do / Recommended

- Use original artwork and avoid copying official insignia, badges, or emblems belonging to national armed forces.
- Clearly state your organization's status on the About page (e.g., "A veteran-run community", "Reenactment group", "Not affiliated with any government or armed force").
- Use neutral language: emphasize community, training, history, or support services.
- Use color palettes inspired by military tones (olive drab, brass, navy) without reproducing exact service liveries.
- Provide clear privacy and data-handling policies for member lists, donations, and messages.

Don't / Avoid

- Impersonating any official military body or using restricted insignia.
- Claiming authority, command, or legal power that you do not possess.
- Facilitating or planning violent or unlawful activities — this is disallowed.

Accessibility & Consent

- Make membership opt-in. Never publish personal contact details without consent.
- Implement a process for members to request removal or redaction of personal info.

Branding assets

- Logo: consider a geometric mark (e.g., shield/chevron) with initials — avoid state symbols.
- Fonts: use strong sans-serif fonts; for a stencil feel use decorative fonts sparingly.
- Imagery: use non-sensitive photos (e.g., group photos, training exercises you have rights to). Blur or redact personally identifying details if needed.

Legal checklist before launch

1. Confirm trademark and emblem restrictions for your country.
2. Publish a clear About and Contact page.
3. Add Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (simple templates are fine for small groups).
4. For donations, ensure compliance with payment provider rules and local charity laws.
