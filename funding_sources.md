# Funding, credits, and sponsorships (quick guide)

This guide lists ways to secure cloud credits, sponsorships, and grants. Since you said "unlimited funds", focus on enterprise-level providers and sponsorship models below.

1) Cloud credits & enterprise sponsorships

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Startups / Google for Startups: contact partner programs for significant credits and support.
- AWS Activate for startups: credits and occasional business development support (apply via YC, Techstars, or direct programs).
- Microsoft for Startups: credits + enterprise GTM for qualified startups.
- DigitalOcean and Vercel sponsor open-source projects and small startups with platform credits.

2) Open source and research grants

- Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) — grants for open source projects with public benefit.
- GitHub Sponsors / Open Source Collective — recurring funding for maintainers.

3) Foundations and non-dilutive grants

- Ford Foundation, Knight Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation — project grants for community/educational work (requires proposal).

4) Corporate sponsorships & enterprise partnerships

- Reach out to larger companies for sponsored features, pilots, or infrastructure sponsorship (Twilio, Stripe, Cloudflare, Algolia, Sentry). These often include credits and joint marketing.

5) Paid services to purchase (if budget is unlimited)

- Managed TURN/SFU provider (Twilio, Agora, LiveSwitch Managed) with enterprise SLA.
- Enterprise Stripe/Payments Concierge for merchant onboarding and lower processing fees.
- Dedicated cloud instances with reserved capacity and direct peering.
