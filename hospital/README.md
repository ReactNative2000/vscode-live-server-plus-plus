# Hospital Inventory (Demo)

This folder contains a minimal demo scaffold for a hospital inventory system. It includes:

- `data/` — sample JSON and CSV data (generated by `tools/generate_hospital_stock.js`).
- `index.html` — a static catalog view (client-side) that can load the JSON file.
- `admin/` — a minimal admin UI that interacts with the sample API.

To generate data locally:

```bash
node tools/generate_hospital_stock.js 200
```
